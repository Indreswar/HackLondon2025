# 🧠 AI Consciousness AGI

A groundbreaking AI system designed to simulate consciousness, reasoning, and adaptive conversations. This project integrates **FAISS** (for fast vector search) and **Neo4j** (for knowledge graph representation) to create an intelligent, memory-persistent AI. The goal is to develop an AI that adapts to users over time, interacts like a friend, and provides problem-solving assistance.

## 🚀 Features

- **Conversational AI** – Engages in dynamic, human-like conversations.
- **Memory Persistence** – Uses **FAISS** for fast retrieval of past interactions.
- **Knowledge Graph** – Utilizes **Neo4j** to structure and connect knowledge.
- **Adaptive Reasoning** – Evolves and adapts based on past experiences.
- **Developer & Public Versions** – 
  - **Developer Version:** Advanced controls, memory tuning, and reasoning settings.
  - **Public Version:** Simplified, intuitive interface for general users.
- **Modular Design** – LangChain and Neo4j are structured in separate modules for scalability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core language for development.
- **FAISS** – For efficient vector-based memory search.
- **Neo4j** – To structure and retrieve knowledge in a graph database.
- **LangChain** – For LLM-based reasoning and interactions.
- **DeepSeek 7B** – The model powering the AI’s conversational capabilities.
- **FastAPI / Flask** – (Planned) For serving the AI via an API.
- **Frontend (TBD)** – A user-friendly UI for seamless interactions.
